This contains my emacs configuration.  First preference is given to ELPA
modules.  That takes away the headache of maintaining multiple modules
for the user.

Just symlink to the .emacs file within this directory in your home directory
or copy and edit.

Largely based on my own configuration and the emacs-starter-kit
at http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit.
